# wheather-App-project
A simple and responsive Weather Application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.   It allows users to search for any city and view the current weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description. The app fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API (or any weather API of your choice).
